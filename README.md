We all have had classes that could use another teacherâ€™s explanation. Finding this mentor is a challenging process. Prodigy allows anyone with a passion to create hyper-personal classrooms that become easily recognizable. Hyper-personal classrooms are environments where teachers can develop a bond with their students. This bond is crucial to helping a student succeed. When a student finds the right teacher, they learn so much more, and they become engaged. Teachers share their experiences, stories, and knowledge with their students and this makes the learning environment more enjoyable. Prodigy is designed to make that relationship between students and teachers virtual and more available to people worldwide. We developed the website to simplify the student's search process to find the correct teacher for them. We also developed the website to help teachers contact students around the world within minutes. 
With the power of machine learning and lots of code, we can enhance the platform's capabilities to make searching a course and recommending courses fast and easy.
