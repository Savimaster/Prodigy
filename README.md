Prodigy is the tool for communication between a student and a teacher. When a student finds the right teacher, they learn so much more and they are engaged. Teachers want to share their experiences, stories, and knowledge with their students and they make the classroom enjoyable. 
Prodigy is designed to make that connection between students and teachers virtual and more available to people around the world. We developed the website to simplify the search process for a student to find the correct teacher for them. We also developed the website to help teachers create their course within minutes. 
With the power of machine learning and lots of code, we are able to enhance the capabilities of the platform to make searching a course and recommending courses fast and easy.
